## Introduction

This project is a custom Firefox theme inspired by the "Tokyo Night" color scheme. It provides a clean, minimalistic, and visually appealing browsing experience by modifying various UI elements within Firefox. The theme applies specific styles to the browser's tabs, toolbar, and other elements to enhance the look and feel of your browsing experience.

## Features

- **Reorganized Toolbar:** Moves essential buttons like the main menu and URL bar to make them more accessible while hiding less frequently used items.
- **Customized Tab Appearance:** Rounded corners, adjusted tab height, and smooth transitions for a modern look.
- **Minimalist Design:** Hides unnecessary elements like the Firefox logo, search bar, and more to focus on the content.
- **Tokyo Night Colors:** Incorporates a dark theme with blue and purple accents, inspired by Tokyo's nightlife.
- **Animated Hover Effects:** Adds subtle animations to tab close buttons and top sites for a more interactive experience.
- **Custom New Tab Page:** Applies a dark, Tokyo-themed background with a welcoming message and custom layout for top sites.
